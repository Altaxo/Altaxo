### Altaxo now runs on Linux! 


I tested this with Ubuntu 16.10 and Wine 2.0, 
which was released recently. 
I had to fix some issues with the font system in Altaxo. 
Many thanks to the Wine team for their nice work! 
A dedicated tutorial how to install Wine 2.0 
and Net framework under Linux will follow.
