It's time to say goodby! 
Goodby to the good old Windows XP! 

The version 4.6.x.x series of Altaxo is now based on .NET framework 4.6,
which does not run on Windows XP anymore. 
However, for a limited time, 
I will still apply bugfixes to the old 4.0.x.x versions 
and even try to keep the Altaxo projects compatible. 
The script editor of the new version is now based on Roslyn, 
so you can enjoy all C#7 features plus QuickInfos, 
easy renaming (F2), view class help (F1), 
and live formatting.
