There is now a new kind of project item available: Markdown enhanced text.

This means that now you can write your notes in Markdown directly in your Altaxo project.
Per Altaxo project folder, there is a special text item called  `folder text`. 
In fact, this is a text item that has the same name as the Altaxo project folder.
Additionally, you can create as many text documents as you want in each folder.

The features of the Markdown editor in Altaxo:

- Editing in both the markdown enhanced source text as well as in the preview window
- Synchronization of the source text view and the preview window
- Colorization of the source text
- Folding of the source text according to the header levels
- Including graphs from the same Altaxo project
- Images are stored locally in Altaxo, connected with the source text (but links to external image sources are also possible)
- Parser for TeX math, including preview of the formulas
- Hierarchical text documents (parent is including child documents)
- Export to Maml, Html, Pdf (by PrintToPdf)
- ... [and much more, see the user manual](https://altaxo.sourceforge.io/AltaxoClassRef/html/4CD3F47316CF9E15CE32CA27833F1734.htm)
