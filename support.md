## Support for Altaxo

Altaxo is free software!
Altaxo is an Open Source project, 
that is covered under the GNU Public License. 
As such, your main form of support for Altaxo will be through 
subscription to the Altaxo mailing list. 
In addition, GitHub has bug tracking capabilities, 
so please report any bugs [there](https://github.com/Altaxo/Altaxo/issues). 
Wish list items will also be considered, 
but I make absolutely no promises.
