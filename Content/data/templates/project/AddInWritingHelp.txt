You have created a new SharpDevelop AddIn project.

We would like to point out that there are three locations where you can get information on how
to write SharpDevelop AddIns:
- http://wiki.sharpdevelop.net/ (section Developer Zone)
- The folder "doc/techtones" in the SharpDevelop source code download
- You can ask questions about AddIn development in the SharpDevelop forum:
   http://community.sharpdevelop.net/forums/

The next steps:
- First, you have to add references to the SharpDevelop assemblies.
  An AddIn will work with the SharpDevelop version it was compiled for, or later service releases.
  You might want to compile against SharpDevelop 2.1.0.2429 (the first official release of SharpDevelop 2.1)
  to ensure your AddIn runs with all later 2.x versions of SharpDevelop.

- Include a <Manifest> section to your .addin for use with the SharpDevelop AddIn Manager.
    See SharpDevelop/doc/technotes/AddInManager.rtf for more information.

- Once you have published your AddIn on the Internet, please add it to the SharpDevelop wiki to let other users know!
    http://wiki.sharpdevelop.net/3rdPartyAddins.ashx


This file serves as a reminder for you on how to find information on SharpDevelop AddIn development, you can
remove it from your project if you don't need it anymore.
