	/**
	 * The AreaIdentifer describes a relative path from  an area a 
	 * to either itself, or to one if its' descendent nodes. An 
	 * AreaIdentifer resembles the ChildSeq syntax in the XPointer 
	 * grammer. The AreaIdentifer path is a sequence of zero based
	 * offsets from one node to one if it's child nodes. If the path 
	 * is empty, it refers to the current area node. 
	 * Identifier paths are relative. A path from node a to node n is
	 * an path with lenght n at a. If b is the child node referneced 
	 * the first element of the path, the path at b now becomes lenght
	 * n - 1, the first element is removed, as that refered to the 
	 * offset at a to b.
	 * 
	 * The GetArea method on Area should interpret a path as :
	 * a.GetArea([k1,k2,...kn]) = a.children[k1].GetArea([k2,k3,...kn]).
	 * 
	 * An identifier from a node to itself is a  zero length, or 
	 * empty path. An identifier from a node to its' first child is a 
	 * path of length 1, with a single element with a value of 0, thus
	 * indicating the 0th child node.
	 * 
	 * Take for example the following area tree:
	 * [area_a]
	 *    |
	 * [area_b, area_c, area_d, area_e]
	 *    |               |
	 * [area_f]        [area_g]
	 *    |               |
	 *    |            [area_h]
	 *    |
	 * [area_i, area_j] 
	 * 
	 * Where we have area_a as the root node, this has a list  of 
	 * children:[area_b,area_c,area_d,area_e], area_b has a child of 
	 * area_f, and so forth. In this case, we have the
	 * following following paths:
	 * 
	 * a -> a = ""
	 * a -> b = "0"
	 * a -> c = "1"
	 * a -> d = "2"
	 * a -> e = "3"
	 * a -> f = a -> b -> f = "0,0"
	 * a -> g = a -> d -> g = "3,0"
	 * a -> i = a -> b -> f -> i = "0,0,0"
	 * a -> j = a -> b -> f -> j = "0,0,1"
	 * a -> h = a -> d -> g -> h = "2,0,0"
	 * 
	 * The methods on AreaIdentifer allow it to be used as a forward 
	 * only enumerator, so that it can be easily pased recursivly 
	 * through an area tree.
