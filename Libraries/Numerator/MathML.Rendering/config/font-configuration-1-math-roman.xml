<!--
	font configuration for the times new roman font
	
	a font config needs to have a root node named "font-configuration", it must
	have a font-name attribute, and may have an optional scaling-factor attribute, 
	this indicates how large this font should be made relative to the current 
	font.
	
	font-configuration needs to have the following nodes, all of these
	may be empty
	
	1: simple-glyph-ranges
	a set of ranges of simple glyphs. this will have a set of "range" child nodes, 
	and each "range" has attributes of "first", "last", and "offset", these
	are the first and last glyph indices in the font, and offset is the number
	to add to the real character that will map to a glyph index.
	
	2: simple-glyphs
	a set of simple glyphs, this has a list of "simple" child nodes, and each
	one of these has attributes of "char" and "index" where char in the 
	character code of the real character, and index in the glyph index in this
	font.
	
	3: stretchy-glyphs
	needs to have a list of "stretchy" child nodes.
	a "stretchy" node must have "char" and "orientation" attributes, 
	these are the real character that will be stretched, and the orientation
	of the stretchy char, either "vertical" or horizontal"
	also, a "stretchy" node needs to have 2 child nodes, "simple" and compound"
	these are the indices in the font of the stretchy glyphs. each one
	of these needs to have an attribute of "index", this is a string of space
	separated numbers representing the index of the glyph. there may be 0 to
	many simple indices, these must be stored smallest to largest glyph size.
	there must be 4 indices for the compound indices. they are:
	index 0 : the bottom glyph, -1 if none exists.
	index 1 : the repeated glyph, this needs to be here.
	index 2 : the middle glyph if one exists, -1 otherwise.
	index 3 : the top glyph if one exists, -1 otherwise.
