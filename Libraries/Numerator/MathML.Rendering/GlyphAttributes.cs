 * store a set of glyph attributes, these are calculated

 * attributes are typically stored in the GlyphMap, and used

 * 
 * A GlyphArea needs all the data in a GlyphAttribute, 
 * except the glyph reference, so the GlyphArea just has
 * a copy of the relative fields.
 * 
 * note, a realized GlyphArea is much larger than a simple
 * GlyphAttributes struct. A GlyphArea has 12 bytes for the class, plus
 * 13 virtuals * 4 bytes = 52 bytes + 22 bytes for attribute data =
 * 74 bytes, A GlyphAttributes is only 
 * Box = 12 bytes + 
 * 2 * float = 8 bytes +
 * Index = 2 bytes +
 * 4 bytes = WeakReference =
 * 26 bytes. 
 * 
 * So we do not create a GlyphArea right away, just keep a weak 
 * reference to it, and create it on a need be basis.
