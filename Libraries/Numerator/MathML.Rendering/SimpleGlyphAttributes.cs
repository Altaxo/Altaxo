	 * of created glyph areas in the FontInstance. However, there
	 * will be far more glyphs than font instances created, so it
	 * is more effcient to store a list of glyphs of varying sizes 
	 * with this struct rather than a list of glyphs in each font 
	 * instance. The reason being, is that once this structure 
	 * is found (there will be a lot of them), we know the mapped
	 * glyph index, so we just search through usually no more than
	 * 5 glyph instances, each with the same glyph index, just created
	 * with different font sizes, rather than searching through 
	 * many glyphs if they would be stored in the FontInstance.
