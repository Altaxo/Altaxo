SharpAssembly 1.0
-----------------

This is the first release of my Assembly reading library.
I was tired of the System.Reflection capabilities (locking assemblies,
app domain troubles no access to method body IL stream etc.) therefore
I've decided to do it on my own.

And here it is ... my first release of the library. I assume that you
should play a bit with it and read following docs:

Tool Developers Guide/docs/Partition I Architecture.doc
Tool Developers Guide/docs/Partition II Metadata.doc
Tool Developers Guide/docs/Partition III CIL.doc

These can be found inside the SDK distribution.
