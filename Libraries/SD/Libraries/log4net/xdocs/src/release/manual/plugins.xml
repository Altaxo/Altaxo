				<p>
					Plugins are additional modular components that are attached to a logger repository.
				</p>
				<p>
					Plugins are stored in the <span class="code">PluginMap</span> of an
					<span class="code">ILoggerRepository</span>. 
					Plugins are attached to the repository by using the <span class="code">PluginMap.Add</span>
					method.
				</p>
				<p>
					The following plugins are included in the log4net package:
				</p>
				<div class="table">
					<table cellspacing="0">
						<tr>
							<th>
								Type</th>
							<th>
								Description</th>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>log4net.Plugin.RemoteLoggingServerPlugin</td>
							<td>
								Creates a remote logging sink that can receive logging events from a 
								<span class="code">RemotingAppender</span>.

				<ul>

						<h3>RemoteLoggingServerPlugin</h3>
						<p>
							Creates a remote logging sink that can receive logging events from a 
							<span class="code">RemotingAppender</span>.
						</p>
						<p>
							Creates a remoting logging sink. A single
							parameter must be passed to the constructor that specifies the sink URI. This is a
							name used to identify the logging sink object published via remoting and must be
							agreed with the client before communication can take place.
						</p>
						<p>
							Example usage:
						</p>
						<source language="C#"><![CDATA[
LogManager.GetRepository().PluginMap.Add(new RemoteLoggingServerPlugin("LoggingSink"));]]></source>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<section id="attributes" name="Plugin Attributes">
					<p>
						Plugins can be configured using the following assembly-level attributes:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<h3>PluginAttribute</h3>
							<p>
								Specifies a plugin type to create and attach to the default repository. This attribute 
								does not allow plugins to be parameterized. The plugin class must have a public default constructor.
							</p>
							<p>
								This attribute may be used as many times as necessary to attach plugins to the repository.
							</p>
						</li>
