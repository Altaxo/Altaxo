			<p>
				The log4net release builds are built using NAnt. Log4net can also be built
				using Visual Studio .NET 2002, 2003, or 2005.
			</p>
			<p>
				To build a release build of log4net you will need to create a strong
				name key file. See the Strong Name section below. 
			</p>
		
			<section id="vsnet" name="Visual Studio">
				<p>
					Visual Studio .NET 2002, 2003 and 2005 are supported build platforms for log4net.
				</p>

				<section id="vsnet-2002" name="Visual Studio .NET 2002">
					<p>
						The log4net distribution includes a solution and project file
						for Visual Studio .NET 2002. Open the <span class="code">log4net.sln</span>
						from the src directory in the distribution.
					</p>
					<p>
						The log4net project requires only the following references:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>System</li>
						<li>System.Data</li>
						<li>System.Web</li>
						<li>System.XML</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section id="vsnet-2003" name="Visual Studio .NET 2003">
					<p>
						Open the Visual Studio .NET 2002 solution file as above. 
						Visual Studio will convert the solution and project files
						to Visual Studio .NET 2003 format.
					</p>
					<p>
						After converting the log4net project you must change the
						<i>Conditional Compilation Constants</i> specified for the
						log4net project. Open the project properties dialog and
						select the <i>Configuration Properties/Build</i> sheet.
						Replace the <c>NET_1_0</c> constant with <c>NET_1_1</c>.
						Remember to do this for both Debug and Release configurations.
					</p>
					<p>
						The log4net project file is not suitable for building log4net
						for the .NET Compact Framework. To build for the Compact Framework
						you must create a new C# project for Smart Devices. Configure the
						project as a library project. Add all the C# files from the 
						src directory in the distribution.
					</p>
				</section>
				
				<section id="vsnet-2005" name="Visual Studio 2005">
					<p>
						Open the Visual Studio .NET 2002 solution file as above. 
						Visual Studio will convert the solution and project files
						to Visual Studio .NET 2003 format.
					</p>
					<p>
						After converting the log4net project you must change the
						<i>Conditional compilation symbols</i> specified for the
						log4net project. Open the project properties page and
						select the <i>Build</i> sheet.
						Replace the <c>NET_1_0</c> symbol with <c>NET_2_0</c>.
						Remember to do this for both Debug and Release configurations.
					</p>
					<p>
						In addition the log4net project requires the following new references:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>System.Configuration</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						The log4net project file is not suitable for building log4net
						for the .NET Compact Framework. To build for the Compact Framework
						you must create a new C# project for Smart Devices. Configure the
						project as a library project. Add all the C# files from the 
						src directory in the distribution.

			<section id="nant" name="NAnt">
				<p>
					The log4net distribution is built using the NAnt tool.
					A recent NAnt version 0.85 nightly build is required to build log4net, this is 
					available from <a href="http://nant.sourceforge.net">nant.sourceforge.net</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					To support building log4net for the SSCLI framework the NAnt configuration
					files need to be updated to specify the SSCLI framework directory.
				</p>
				<p>
					To build log4net from the command line, change directory to the root of the
					log4net distribution, ensure that the nant executable is in the
					PATH, and then run the following command:
				</p>
				<div class="syntax"><pre class="code">
nant -buildfile:log4net.build compile-all</pre></div>
				<p>
					This command will build log4net for all the supported frameworks
					that are available on the current machine. To list all the build
					targets that are available run the following command:
				</p>
				<div class="syntax"><pre class="code">
nant -buildfile:log4net.build -projecthelp</pre></div>
				<p>
					Under windows the <span class="code">build.cmd</span> can be used 
					to script the nant build. This can be called from a different
					directory and will locate the correct log4net.build file to use.
					For example:
				</p>
				<div class="syntax"><pre class="code">
build.cmd compile-all</pre></div>
			</section>

			<section id="sn" name="Strong Name">
				<p>
					In order to build the Release builds of log4net a Strong
					Name key is required. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Use the <span class="code">sn.exe</span> tool in the 
					.NET Framework SDK to generate a strong name key pair.
				</p>
				<div class="syntax"><pre class="code">
sn -k log4net.snk</pre></div>
				<p>
					The log4net.snk file should be placed in the root of the
					log4net distribution, in the same folder as the log4net.build
					file.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sdk" name="SDK Reference">
				<p>
					NDoc 1.3 is used to build the log4net SDK documentation.
					NDoc is available from <a href="http://ndoc.sourceforge.net">ndoc.sourceforge.net</a>.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section id="html" name="HTML Documentation">
				<p>
					The log4net HTML documentation is built using Velocity.
					The source are XML files in the <span class="code">xdocs/src</span> directory.
					Building the documentation requires Java, Ant, and Velocity.
					Run ant from within the <span class="code">xdocs</span> directory.
