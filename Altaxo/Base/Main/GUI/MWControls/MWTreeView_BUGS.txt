Setting the RubberbandGradientBlend and RubberbandGradientColorBlend properties in the Visual Studio GUI does not work properly.
	Everytime the code is recompiled the properties are reset.
	Maybe this is an initialization problem of the variables underlying the properties or maybe it has got to do with the UITypeEditor used.
