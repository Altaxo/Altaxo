Changes made to v1.0.3.5

MWTreeView
==================================================
EventHandler OnKeyDown: For Keys.F2: LabelEditing is not allowed if the rubberband has been painted (i.e. if bRubberbandHasBeenPainted).
Added another overload for RemoveNodes taking a Hashtable as an argument.
Added method RemoveSelectedNodes.
Added property TreeNodeMouseDown (public and get only).
Added property TreeNodeMouseDownInt (private) to allow for OnAfterTreeNodeMouseDownChanged being raised.
Added Event AfterTreeNodeMouseDownChanged and EventHandler OnAfterTreeNodeMouseDownChanged. (Before Event/EventHandler is not added since setting the
	tnMouseDown variable should not be cancelable.)
Modified method IsLabelEditRegExSatisfied.
Modified the SelNode property. Thanks to Jason W Farrell for finding the bug.
Added new variable bRubberbandIsOnScreen that helps in determining whether or not to start LabelEditing from mouse clicks (OnMouseUp).
Modified EventHandler OnMouseUp: Changed if-statement before a LabelEdit (tn.BeginEdit()) is started on a TreeNode and setting new variable
	bRubberbandIsOnScreen to false at the end.
Modified EventHandler OnMouseMove: Setting new variable bRubberbandIsOnScreen to true if rubberband painting should start.
Modified EventHandler OnKeyDown: LabelEdit can now be initiated even if the rubberband is on screen as long as no mouse button is pressed.
Property SelNodes: Calling MWTreeNodeWrapper.Deselect instead of the member method Reset which was removed.
Static methods ChangeTreeNodeImageIndex, ChangeTreeNodeSelectedImageIndex and ChangeTreeNodeImageIndices added. Use these when changin the ImageIndex
	and/or the SelectedImageIndex of TreeNodes.
Events have been fixed up.
	An MWCancelEventHandler delegate was added so that EventHandlers using MWCancelEventArgs are now actually using MWCancelEventArgs as opposed to
	plain EventArgs. The following events had their types changed from EventHandler to MWCancelEventHandler:
		BeforeMultiSelectChanged
		BeforeAllowMultiCheckChanged
		BeforeAllowNoSelNodeChanged
		BeforeAllowBlankNodeTextChanged
		BeforeSelNodesChanged
		BeforeSelNodeChanged
		BeforeCheckedNodesChanged
		BeforeScrollToSelNodeChanged

		BeforeCheckNodeRegExChanged
	AfterSelNodeChanged and AfterTreeNodeMouseDownChanged are now of type MWPropertyEventHandler.
	Changed SelNodeInt and TreeNodeMouseDownInt.

CheckedNodes now have events being raised when TreeNodes are added and removed. Changes were made to:
		OnBeforeCheck
		CheckNode
		UncheckNode
		ClearCheckedNodes
	Added:
		CheckedNodesAdd

		OnMouseUp
		OnMouseMove (way to many events were being fired unnecessarily)
		MultiSelect
		SelectNode
		DeselectNode
		ClearSelNodes
		ClearSelNodes(TreeNode tn)
		ClearSelNodes(TreeNode tnFrom, TreeNode tnTo, bool bOnlyVisible)
		ClearSelBranch

		SelNodesRemove
		BeforeSelNodesRemove
		OnBeforeSelNodesRemove
		AfterSelNodesRemove
		OnAfterSelNodesRemove
Added methods AddNode and AddNodeInt to allow VB6-style adding of TreeNodes. The need for a method like this was expressed by Jonatan Rullman.
Changed methods CheckNode and UncheckNode. TreeNodes can now be checked and unchecked programmatically.
Added new TreeViewMultiSelect MultiAllDescendants.
Changed the following methods to handle TreeViewMultiSelect.MultiAllDescendants:
	BeforeSelectMethod
	OnKeyDown
	OnMouseMove
	SelectNode
Changed method OnBeforeSelect so that FullRowSelect works properly when deselecting TreeNodes.
Changes made so that BeforeSelNodeChanged and AfterSelNodeChanged events are only triggered for the TreeNode that is selected/deselected, not all
	child TreeNodes when e.g. alt-clicking or when using TreeViewMultiSelect.MultiAllDescendants.
	This change is made as a step towards having different events being triggered when a bunch of TreeNodes are selected/deselected from e.g. alt-clicking on
		a TreeNode with child TreeNodes.
	Added method SelectBranchIterative (internal method meant to be called from method SelectBranch).
	Methods changed:

		OnKeyDown
		OnMouseMove
		SelectNode

	Added new property:
		LabelEditTimeout
	Changed property:
		SelNodeInt
Fixed TreeViewMultiSelect.NoMulti so that it works the way it is supposed to - it was working like TreeViewMultiSelect.Classic (not much of a point to have
	a Classic then is it).
	Changed methods, EventHandlers and properties:
		OnBeforeSelect
		OnKeyDown, for the following keys:
			Keys.Down
			Keys.Up
			Keys.Right

		OnKeyDown for the key Keys.Escape
Fixed: When rubberband selecting and FullRowSelect is ON (it works for OFF!) e.g. TreeNode L0N4Child11 to L0N4Child20. First time the TreeNodes get selected.
	The second time (without doing anything else in between) ONLY TreeNode L0N4Child11 and TreeNode L0N4Child20 are selected, i.e. TreeNodes L0N4Child12 to
	L0N4Child19 are DESELECTED.
	Changed EventHandler:
		OnMouseUp
Changed MWTreeView so that it is optional whether the modifier-keys execute extended functionality or not.

		from '(Control.ModifierKeys & Keys.Control) == 0' to '!MouseModKeyControl'
		from '(Control.ModifierKeys & Keys.Control) != 0' to 'MouseModKeyControl'
		from '(Control.ModifierKeys & Keys.Shift) == 0' to '!MouseModKeyShift'
		from '(Control.ModifierKeys & Keys.Shift) != 0' to 'MouseModKeyShift'
	Changed most calls from the following (to calls to new methods) (done in method OnKeyDown):
			from '(e.Modifiers & Keys.Alt) == 0' to '!KeyboardModKeyAlt(e.Modifiers)'
			from '(e.Modifiers & Keys.Alt) != 0' to 'KeyboardModKeyAlt(e.Modifiers)'
			from '(e.Modifiers & Keys.Control) == 0' to '!KeyboardModKeyControl(e.Modifiers)'
			from '(e.Modifiers & Keys.Control) != 0' to 'KeyboardModKeyControl(e.Modifiers)'
			from '(e.Modifiers & Keys.Shift) == 0' to '!KeyboardModKeyShift(e.Modifiers)'
			from '(e.Modifiers & Keys.Shift) != 0' to 'KeyboardModKeyShift(e.Modifiers)'
		The ones that were not changed according to above were changed from '(e.Modifiers & Keys.Control) == 0)' to new method
			'!KeyboardModKeyNavigation(e.Modifiers)' in order to enable the new property AllowControlKeyNavigation (and variable and EventHandlers) to
			function (see comment below).
Added property AllowControlKeyNavigation (and variable and EventHandlers) that enables/disables the navigation/scrolling that is achieved by the normal
		TreeView by holding down the Control key and then pressing the Down, Up, Right, Left, Home, End, PageUp or PageDown keys (see comment above).
	Changed the OnKeyDown EventHandler for this.
Changed the way TreeNodes are rubberband selected when in MultiSelect modes MultiSameBranch and MultiSameBranchAndLevel so they function more like

		Changed method BeforeSelectMethod for this.
Added new property AllowMultipleExpandedPaths (and variable and EventHandlers) that lets you decide whether only one path can be expanded at a time or the
		standard (default) behavior which allows multiple paths to be expanded at once.
	Note that when one path is already expanded and another is being expanded the first one collapses.
	Added overrides to the following EventHandlers to maintain this behavior while the MWTreeView is running:
		OnBeforeExpand
		OnAfterExpand
Added new property ExpandBeforeCollapse (and variable and EventHandlers) that decides whether the newly expanding TreeNode expands before or after the
	previously expanded TreeNode collapses
Added the following new properties:
		AllowKeyASelectAll
		AllowKeyEExpandAll
		AllowKeyEscapeDeselectAll
		AllowKeyF2LabelEditing
		AllowKeyQCollapseAll
	that decide whether the MWTreeView handles extended behavior or not.
	Changed the OnKeyDown EventHandler for this.
Added property RubberbandSelectionExpandCollapseTimeout (with min-value 0ms, max-value 10000ms and default-value 1000ms) (and variable and EventHandlers)
		and Timers tRubberbandSelectionAllowedExpand and tRubberbandSelectionAllowedCollapse that handle when rubberband selection should start while
		still holding the left mouse button down after expanding/collapsing a TreeNode.
	This uses the variables bExpandInProgress and bCollapseInProgress in the following methods:
		OnMouseDown
		OnMouseMove
		OnBeforeExpand (newly overridden EventHandler)
		OnBeforeCollapse (newly overridden EventHandler)
		tRubberbandSelectionAllowedExpand_Tick
		tRubberbandSelectionAllowedCollapse_Tick
		BeginAllowRubberbandSelectionExpand

	Behavior, MW - Mouse-Selection
	Behavior, MW - Rubberband-Selection
