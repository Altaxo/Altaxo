The AltaxoCore library would not be possible without the contributions from the open source community.
AltaxoCore contains contributions from the following projects (in alphabetic order):

- dnAnalytics (www.dnAnalytics.net):
	most part of the linear algebra namespace (including blas and lapack support), optimization namespace

- Exocortex DSP (www.exocortex.org)
	complex number classes (but now partially replaced by routines from the Gnu Scientific library), Fourier transformations

- FFT library (www.jjj.de):
	Fourier transformations

- FORTRAN algorithms (translated by f2c to C++, then manually to C#) from the ACM and other public sources

- Gnu Scientific library (www.gsl.org)
	complex number mathematics

- LevMar (Levenberg-Marquardt implementation by Manolis Lourakis, lourakis@ics.forth.gr)
	nonlinear regression

- MaPack (http://www.aisto.com/roeder/dotnet)
	linear algebra

- MatPack (www.matpack.de):
	Special functions, interpolation, random numbers, nonlinear regression, Fourier transformations, ...
