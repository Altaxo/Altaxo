# Contents of this project #

This project contains classes that are:
- that are essential to run a workbench (i.e. a windows like surface with multiple document windows, toolbars, etc.)
- in contrast to the classes in WorkbenchCore, classes here **are** dependent on a Gui technology, like Wpf or WindowsForms
- if classes are independent on Gui technology, move them to WorkbenchCore
