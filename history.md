## History of Altaxo

I wrote Altaxo as an effort to learn C#. 
The best way to do that is to write a nontrivial program in that language. 
For a long time I searched for a free **Alt**ernative to plotting programs 
like MathSoft **Ax**um® or Microcal **O**rigin®. 
Of course there is Gnuplot, but it's command line centric. 
So in 2002 I decided to learn C# by writing a plotting program.

A short 'CV' of Altaxo:

* 2002/06: start of the development
* 2003/03: registering at SourceForge
* 2003/03: initial commit to a code versioning system (at this time it was really CVS!)
* 2003/09: switch to zipped XML for saving of Altaxo documents
* 2003/10: using the SharpDevelop workbench as Gui system
* 2003/11: syntax highlighting and code completion in script dialogs
* 2004/04: change of the code versioning system to Subversion
* 2004/06: commands for chemometric data analysis (PLS, PLS2, PCR)
* 2004/12: Multivariate regression support
* 2005: nonlinear regression, linear algebra (thanks to the dnAnalytics project), background styles
* 2006: MathML is used for showing fit function descriptions, clipboard operations, enhanced Gui for pens and brushes, polar plots, waterfall plots
* 2007: plotting functions, support for texture brushes, bar graphs, density plots, transposing worksheets
* 2008: calculation of stable distributions with very high accuracy, JCamp import
* 2009: adding more options to text labels, refactoring of the code in order to be prepared for the transition of the Gui system from WinForms to WPF
* 2010: organization into project folders, switching to WPF technology
* 2011: switching to WPF completed, major enhancements to the project explorer, bulk exporter, clipboard operations between different instances of Altaxo, switching to Mercurial as version control system
* 2012: auto-updates of Altaxo
* 2013: complete redesign of the positioning and layer system
* 2014: COM/OLE functionality, property bags
* 2015: Altaxo is going 3D
* 2016: Refine the 3D graphs
* 2017: Update to .NET framework 4.6 and use Roslyn as C# compiler
* 2018: Markdown text, complete reorganization of the underlying architecture, separate from SharpDevelop
* 2019: Add export of Markdown to OpenXML (.docx files)
* 2020: Add nullability awareness to the source code
* 2021: Switch to Vortice library and DirectX11 for 3D plotting, add many new fitting functions
* 2022: Integration of MathNet.Numerics into Altaxo's core library, spectral processing
