## Welcome to the Altaxo project page!

Altaxo is a plotting and data analyzing program with a nice graphical user interface. Data analysis is convenient and fast. If the many built-in possibilities are still not fit your requirements: Almost everything in Altaxo can be scripted, using compiled C# code. Modern features like syntax highlighting and code completion renders scripting really easy. And you have access to a huge mathematical and signal processing library, which is constantly improved. If you want to permanently extend the features of Altaxo, you can even do this by writing an extension to Altaxo, which integrates seamlessly with the main program.
